Scope


This document is aimed at both publishers and consumers of Linked Data. We assume that the reader has a certain familiarity with RDF and RDF Schema as well as well-known vocabularies, such as FOAF
or Dublin Core. The goal of the document is to specify an interoperable way to describe people and their relationships to other entities such as organisations or projects.




1. Introduction


This section is non-normative.



1.1 Terminology


source data
        Data from datastores such as RDBs or spreadsheets that acts as a source for the Linked Data publishing process.
publisher
        A person or organization that exposes source data as Linked Data on the Web.
consumer
        A person or agent that uses Linked Data from the Web.

@@TODO: point out definition of source data in the BP document for further details.




1.2 Conventions


The key words must, must not, required, should, should not, recommended, may, and optional in this specification are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Examples of RDF serialisations in this document are written in the Turtle [TURTLE] syntax; we assume the following namespace prefix bindings unless otherwise stated:

Prefix IRI
rdf: 
http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#

rdfs: 
http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#

dct: 
http://purl.org/dc/terms/

xsd: 
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#





1.3 Walkthrough example


In many cases, source data contains data about people and other, related entities. We will use the following text as an example throughout the document to demonstrate the usage of terms:

Jane Doe is CEO of ColCids Inc., headquartered in 2242 Old Middlefield Way, Mountain View, CA, United States.
Recently, ColCids won a contract for providing an Open Data platform, awarded by the Santa Clara County. The
project, called OpenData4SantaClara, starts on 1 Feb 2013 and runs initially for three months. Jane's contact
point in the County of Santa Clara is Björk Guðmundsdóttir. To ensure a successful project delivery, Jane has
invited 東海林賢蔵, a business contact and Open Data guru she recently met at a local event, to brief her and 
the CoolCids team on the challenges and requirements in the domain.

Note: if you're not familiar with people's names throughout the world, you might want to read the personal names around the world article provided by the W3C Internationalization (I18n) Activity.

3. What is a person?


The core concept we are dealing with in this document is that of a person. A person in the context of this specification is defined as an entity of type foaf:Person.

If only the person's name is known foaf:name must be used.

<http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> rdf:type foaf:Person ;
                                       foaf:name "Björk Guðmundsdóttir" .

How to provide further details about a person, such as an address, is specified in section relating a person to a contact information.


Best Practice 1: Deriving domain-specific person types

One sometimes finds specialisations of a person in a domain, for example, in the legal domain there is a distinction made between a natural person and a legal person. In such a case the publisher
should, in addition to the domain-specific type (e.g., legal:NaturalPerson) explicitly set the type foaf:Person in order to increase interoperability. This also allow systems that do not perform
reasoning, for example, plain SPARQL processors to benefit from it. Read more ...





4. Relating a person to other entities


Beyond stating the basic characteristics of a person one can relate a person to a target entity such as an organisation or project. The following sections normatively specify how to do this. For any
target entity type not listed in the below sections the publisher is free to use any appropriate vocabulary. See also the (@@link) vocabulary selection section of the Best Practices for Publishing
Linked Data document for guidance on how to find and select such a vocabulary.

ISSUE-18



4.1 Relating a person to a contact information


In order to relate a person to a contact information, such as typically found on a business card:

1. the contact information must be represented using vCard, and

   ISSUE-22

2. the link type used between a person and a contact information must be gldp:card.

   ISSUE-24


@prefix gldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/people#> .
@prefix : <http://colcids.com/person/> .
	
:42 a foaf:Person ;
    gldp:card :42#bc .

:42#bc a v:VCard ;
       v:fn "Jane Doe" ;
       ...




4.2 Relating a person to another person


In order to relate a person to another person one must use the FOAF Vocabulary Specification:

* To state that one person knows another person, foaf:knows must be used.
* To state other relationships between people, the RELATIONSHIP vocabulary should be used.

<http://colcids.com/person/42> foaf:knows <http://opendataguru.net/me> .


Best Practice 2: Trusting people's relationships

A foaf:knows only establishes an unidirectional claim that someone knows someone else. The relation should only be considered to be of a mutual nature if the other person sets a foaf:knows relation
as well. Read more ...





4.3 Relating a person to an organization


In order to relate a person to an organization one must use the Organization Ontology.

<http://colcids.com/company> a org:FormalOrganization .

<http://colcids.com/person/42> a foaf:Person .

_:bn123 a org:Membership ;
        org:organization <http://colcids.com/company> ;
        org:member <http://colcids.com/person/42> .

ISSUE-19




4.4 Relating a person to a building or room


In order to relate a person to a building or room one must use the Buildings and Rooms Vocabulary.

To state that a person is located in a building or room rooms:occupant must be used.

@prefix rooms: <http://vocab.deri.ie/rooms#> .
@prefix :  <>.

<http://colcids.com/person/42> a foaf:Person .

:CCHQ a rooms:Building ;
      rooms:contains :r101 .

:r101 a rooms:Room ;
      rooms:occupant <http://colcids.com/person/42> .

ISSUE-23




4.5 Relating a person to a project


In order to relate a person to a project one must use the FOAF Vocabulary Specification.

@prefix gldp: <http://www.w3.org/ns/people#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix :  <http://data.sccgov.org/project/> .

<http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> a foaf:Person .

:OpenData4SantaClara a foaf:Project ;
                     gldp:title "OpenData4SantaClara" ;
                     rdfs:label "OpenData4SantaClara" ;
                     gldp:lead <http://data.sccgov.org/people/björkg> ;
                     gldp:starts "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
                     gldp:ends "2013-05-01T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .


Best Practice 3: Multiple label properties

In order to enable generic Linked Data browsers, such as Tabulator, which typically hard-code well-known label terms to display human readable labels rather than URIs, one should repeat the content
of the gldp:title's literal object in an rdfs:label literal object.


ISSUE-20




4.6 Relating a person to online posts


In order to relate a person to online posts such as blog posts, mailing list posts, etc, one must use the SIOC Core Ontology Specification.

@prefix sioc: <http://rdfs.org/sioc/ns#> .

<http://blog.colcids.com/2012/12/01/launching-opendata4santaclara/> a sioc:Post ;
                                                                    dct:title "OpenData4SantaClara will launch in early 2013" ;
                                                                    dct:created "2012-12-01T17:25:30Z" ;
                                                                    sioc:has_creator <http://colcids.com/person/42> .

<http://colcids.com/person/42> a sioc:User .





5. Terms


This section defines terms that allow to relate a person to other entities, such as contact information, etc. The terms below are defined in the namespace URI http://www.w3.org/ns/people# and the
preferred namespace prefix for the namespace URI is gldp.

An implementer of this spec must support the following terms:

Term Definition
gldp:card Relates a foaf:Person to a v:VCard; read: a person has a business card.
gldp:ends Specifies the end date of a foaf:Project as an xsd:dateTime [XMLSCHEMA2]; read: a project ends on date.
gldp:lead Relates a foaf:Project to a foaf:Person; read: a project has a project lead.
gldp:starts Specifies the start date of a foaf:Project as an xsd:dateTime [XMLSCHEMA2]; read: a project starts on date.
gldp:title Specifies the title of a foaf:Project as an xsd:string [XMLSCHEMA2]; read: a projects has a title.




6. Interoperability considerations


Our concept of a person is based on foaf:Person, but there are many more conceptualisations in use, for example as defined by the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA)
project, the Schema.org project by the search engine providers Bing, Google, Yahoo! or as found in the Personal Information Model (PIMO) by the Semantic Desktop project.

To enable interoperability and, in general, to make the data more useful, we define mappings of terms, in the following. An implementer of this spec should support these mappings.

ISSUE-21



6.1 Mapping to ISA Core Person Vocabulary


@@TODO: evaluate ISA Core Person Vocabulary and identify how and what to map.




6.2 Mapping to Schema.org


@@TODO: evaluate schema:Person and identify how and what to map.




6.3 Mapping to Personal Information Model (PIMO)


@@TODO: evaluate pimo:Person and identify how and what to map.
