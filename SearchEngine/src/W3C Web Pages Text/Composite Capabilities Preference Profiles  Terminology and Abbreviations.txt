1. Terminology


The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "MAY," and "MAY NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

The following terms are used in this document.

Anonymization
        Hiding the identity of the user as a security precaution.
Assurance of origin
        Information provided to the receiver of a message that allows it to be certain of the origin of the message. (This assurance may not be sufficient to convince any other party about the
        origin of the message.)
Assurance of receipt
        Information provided to the sender of a message that allows it to be certain that the message was delivered to its intended recipient. This is not necessarily a proof of receipt.
Attributes
        A CC/PP attribute refers to the data elements describing the profile and is denoted as an RDF property. Each CC/PP attribute is associated with a value or a list of values or resources.
Authentication
        Some communication process that provides definite and tamper-proof information about the identity of a communicating party.
Authorization
        Permission to view or modify a data resource, or to perform some other action. Authorization is usually granted to an identified entity, and thus depends on authentication of the party
        performing the action.
CC/PP Repository
        A server that stores the user agent profile or profile segments persistently in a form that may be referenced by and incorporated into a profile. A CC/PP repository is typically a Web server
        that provides CC/PP profiles or profile segments in response to HTTP requests.
Cacheable
        A data resource is said to be "cacheable" if the data resource contains a property that allows a sever to determine whether the cached resource matches a request for a similar resource.
Cache
        A storage area used by a server or proxy to store data resources that have been retrieved or created in response to a request. When a new request for a "cached" data resource is received,
        the server or proxy can respond with the cached version instead of retrieving or creating a new copy.
Capability
        An attribute of a sender or receiver (often the receiver) which indicates an ability to generate or process a particular type of message content. See also "Attributes".
Channel security
        A form of security (authentication and/or confidentiality) that operates on a given communication channel, regardless of the information that is transferred over that channel. The security
        thus provided is between the end-points of the channel only.
Client
        An entity that is the original compositor of a CC/PP profile.
Confidentiality
        Protecting the content of a message from unauthorized disclosure.
Content Generation
        For the purpose of this specification, "content generation" refers to generating content appropriate to the user agent profile of the request by using the user agent profile as input to a
        dynamic content generation engine. The XSL and style sheets of the document are used to tailor the document to the user agent profile of the request.
Content Negotiation
        The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when servicing a request. The representation of entities in any response can be negotiated (including error responses).
Content Selection
        For the purpose of this specification, "content selection" refers to selecting an appropriate document from a list of possible choices or variants by matching the document profile with the
        user agent profile of the request.
Content Provider
        A server that originates content in response to a request.
Data Resource
        A data object that can be transferred across a network. Data resources may be available in multiple representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, resolutions) or vary in
        other ways.
Document
        For the purpose of this specification, "document" refers to content supplied in response to a request. Using this definition, a "document" may be a collection of smaller "documents", which
        in turn is a part of a greater "document".
Document Profile
        Document profiles offer a means to characterize the features appropriate to given categories of user agents. For instance, one profile might include support for style sheets, vector graphics
        and scripting, while another might be restricted to the tags in HTML 3.2. Document profiles can be used by servers to select between document variants developed for different user agent
        categories. They can be used to determine what transformations to apply when such variants are not available. Content developers can use document profiles to ensure that their web sites will
        be rendered as intended.
Dynamic Content
        Content that is generated in response to a request. This may be used for content that depends on changing environmental factors such as time (e.g., stock quotes) or place (e.g., nearby gas
        stations)
Feature
        Functional property of a device or entity.
Gateway
        Software that is capable of bridging disparate network protocols. For the purposes of this specification, "gateway" refers to protocol bridging functionality, which may exist in a
        stand-alone gateway or may be co-located with a proxy or origin server.
Hint
        A suggestion or preference for a particular option. While this option is strongly recommended, its use is not required.
Integrity
        Procedures applied to ensure that information is not corrupted in transit. Different integrity procedures may protect against accidental or intentional corruption of data.
Machine Understandable
        Data that is described with tags that associate a meaning to the data (i.e., an "author" tag would describe the author of the document), allowing data to be searched or combined and not just
        displayed.
Namespace
        A qualifier added to an XML tag to ensure uniqueness among XML elements.
Negotiate Content
        Message content that has been selected by content negotiation.
Negotiation Metadata
        Information which is exchanged between the sender and the receiver of a message by content negotiation in order to determine the variant which should be transferred.
Non-repudiation
        This term has been the subject of much dispute. Broadly speaking, it is a process that prevents a party to a communication from subsequently denying that the communication took place, or
        from denying the content of the communication. Sometimes this term is used in a purely technical sense (e.g. generation of data that is dependent on the communication and its content) and
        sometimes in a legal sense (i.e. evidence that could be sustained in a court of law).
Non-Repudiation of Origin
        The ability of the receiver to verify the source of the information.
Non-Repudiation of Receipt
        The ability of the sender to verify that the intended recipient received the information.
Non-variant Content
        When the form/format of the content being sent does not depend on receiver's capabilities and/or preferences
Object security
        A form of security (authentication and/or confidentiality) that operates on an item of data (a object), regardless of the communication channel over which it is passed. Object security can
        apply to data that is passed over several different data channels in succession, but cannot be used to protect message addressing and other transfer-related information.
Origin Server
        Software that can respond to requests by delivering appropriate content or error messages. The origin server may receive requests via either WSP or HTTP. Application programs executing on
        the origin server deliver content that is tailored in accordance with the CC/PP that can be found within the provided profile. For the purpose of this specification, "origin server" refers
        to content generation capabilities, which may physically exist in a stand-alone Web server or may be co-located with a proxy or gateway.
Preference
        An attribute of a sender or receiver (often the receiver) which indicates a preference to generate or process one particular type of message content over another, even if both are possible.
Privacy
        Preventing the unintended or unauthorized disclosure of information about a person. Such information may be contained within a message, but may also be inferred from patterns of
        communication; e.g. when communications happen, the types of resource accessed, the parties withwhom communication occurs, etc.
Profile
        An instance of the schema that describe capabilities for a specific device and network. A profile need not have all the attributes identified in the vocabulary/schema.
Proof of receipt, or Proof of delivery
        Information provided to the sender of a message that allows them to prove subsequently to a third party that the message was delivered to its intended recipient. (This proof may not
        necessarily be legally sustainable.)
Proxy
        Software that receives HTTP requests and forwards that request toward the origin server (possibly by way of an upstream proxy) using HTTP. The proxy receives the response from the origin
        server and forwards it to the requesting client. In providing its forwarding functions, the proxy may modify either the request or response or provide other value-added functions. For the
        purposes of this specification, "proxy" refers to request/response forwarding functionality, which may exist in a stand-alone HTTP proxy or may be co-located with a gateway or origin server.
RDF Resource
        An object or element being described by RDF expressions is a resource. An RDF resource is identified by a URI.
Receiver
        A system component (device or program) which receives a message.
Receiver-initiated Transmission
        A message transmission which is requested by the eventual receiver of the message. Sometimes described as "pull" messaging. E.g. an HTTP GET operation.
Schema
        An RDF schema denotes resources which constitute the particular unchanging versions of an RDF vocabulary at any point in time. It is used to provide semantic information (such as
        organization and relationship) about the interpretation of the statements in an RDF data model. It does not include the values associated with the attributes.
Security
        Describes a set of procedures applied to data communications to ensure that information is transferred exactly as the sender and receiver intend, and in no other way. Security generally
        breaks down into integrity, authentication, confidentiality and Privacy.
Sender
        A system component (device or program) which transmits a message.
Sender-initiated transmission
        A message transmission which is invoked by the sender of the message. Sometimes described as "push" messaging. E.g. sending an email.
User
        An individual or group of individuals acting as a single entity. The user is further qualified as an entity who uses a device to request content and/or resource from a server.
User agent
        A program, such as a browser, running on the device that acts on a user's behalf. Users may use different user agents at different times.
User Agent Profile
        Capabilities and preference Information pertaining to the capabilities of the device, the operating and network environment, and users personal preferences for receiving content and/or
        resource.
Variant
        One of several possible representations of a data resource.
Variant Content
        When the form/format of the content being sent depends on receiver's capabilities and/or preferences
Vocabulary
        A collection of attributes that adequately describe the CC/PP. A vocabulary is associated with a schema.
