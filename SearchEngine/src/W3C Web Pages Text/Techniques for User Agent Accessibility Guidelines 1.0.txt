Abstract


This document provides techniques for satisfying the checkpoints defined in "User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0" [UAAG10]. These techniques address key aspects of the accessibility of user
interfaces, content rendering, application programming interfaces (APIs), and languages such as the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and the Synchronized Multimedia
Integration Language (SMIL).

The techniques listed in this document are not required for conformance to the Guidelines. These techniques are not necessarily the only way of satisfying the checkpoint, nor are they a definitive
set of requirements for satisfying a checkpoint.


Status of this document


This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. The latest status of this document series is maintained at the W3C.

This is the 17 December 2002 Note of "Techniques for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0." It is a draft document and may be updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is
inappropriate to use this document as reference material or to cite it as other than "work in progress." Though this document has been endorsed by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working
Group, it has not been endorsed by the W3C Membership.

While User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 strives to be a stable document (as a W3C Recommendation), the current document is expected to evolve as technologies change and software developers
discover more effective techniques for designing accessible user agents.

This document was produced by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG). The goals of the UAWG are described in UAWG charter. The complete list of changes to this document is
available on the Web.

The UAWG also provides additional resources to support this document (e.g., Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about UAAG 1.0, implementation reports, and test suites). Please consult the UAWG home
page for more information.

Patent disclosures relevant to this specification may be found on the Working Group's patent disclosure page in conformance with W3C policy.

This document is part of a series of accessibility documents published by the ) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WAI Accessibility Guidelines are produced as part of the WAI Technical
Activity.
