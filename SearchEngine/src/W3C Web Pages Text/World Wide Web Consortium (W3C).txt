W3C Invites Implementations of Linked Data Platform 1.0


19 June 2014 | Archive



The Linked Data Platform (LDP) Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of Linked Data Platform 1.0. This document describes a set of best practices and simple approach
for a read-write Linked Data architecture, based on HTTP access to web resources that describe their state using the RDF data model. Learn more about the Data Activity.






Last Call: Vibration API, Ambient Light Events, HTML Media Capture


19 June 2014 | Archive



The Device APIs Working Group has published three Last Call Working Drafts today:

* Vibration API. This specification defines an API that provides access to the vibration mechanism of the hosting device. Vibration is a form of tactile feedback.
* Ambient Light Events. This specification defines a means to receive events that correspond to a light sensor detecting the presence of a light.
* HTML Media Capture. The HTML Media Capture specification defines an HTML form extension that facilitates user access to a device&#x2019;s media capture mechanism, such as a camera, or
  microphone, from within a file upload control.

Comments on these three specifications are welcome through 24 July 2014. Learn more about the Ubiquitous Web Applications Activity.






W3C Invites Implementations of DOM Parsing and Serialization


17 June 2014 | Archive



The Web Applications Working Group invites implementation of the Candidate Recommendation of DOM Parsing and Serialization. This specification defines various APIs for programmatic access to HTML
and generic XML parsers by web applications for use in parsing and serializing DOM nodes.

The group also published a Working Draft of Shadow DOM. This specification describes a method of combining multiple DOM trees into one hierarchy and how these trees interact with each other within a
document, thus enabling better composition of the DOM.

Learn more about the Rich Web Client Activity.






Last Call: HTML5


17 June 2014 | Archive



The HTML Working Group has published a Last Call Working Draft of HTML5. This specification defines the 5th major revision of the core language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML). In this version, new features are introduced to help Web application authors, new elements are introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and special attention has
been given to defining clear conformance criteria for user agents in an effort to improve interoperability. Comments are welcome through 15 July 2014.

The group also published a Working Draft of HTML 5.1. HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and adaptations over the
years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents. The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web Applications.
This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML language to address issues raised in the past few years.

Learn more about the HTML Activity.






Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 (Core-AAM) First Public Working Draft and WAI-ARIA 1.1 updated Working Draft


12 June 2014 | Archive



The Protocols and Formats Working Group today published a First Public Working Draft of Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 (Core-AAM), which supports the updated Working Draft of Accessible Rich
Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1. WAI-ARIA provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. WAI-ARIA is designed to improve the accessibility
and interoperability of web content, particularly web applications. Core-AAM describes how user agents should expose semantics of content languages to accessibility APIs across multiple content
technologies (including much of WAI-ARIA). Core-AAM serves as the basis for other specifications to extend the mappings to specific technologies. Learn more from the call for review e-mail and read
about the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).






Three Specifications Published by the Web Applications Working Group


12 June 2014 | Archive



The Web Applications Working Group has published three documents today:

* A First Public Working Draft of DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent key Values. This specification defines the values for the KeyboardEvent.key attribute, which is defined as part of the Document Object
  Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification. The key attribute contains information about the character generated by the key event.
* A First Public Working Draft of DOM Level 3 KeyboardEvent code Values. This specification defines the values for the KeyboardEvent.code attribute, which is defined as part of the Document Object
  Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification. The code value contains information about the key event that can use used identify the physical key being pressed by the user.
* A Working Draft of UI Events. This specification extends the events and features defined in DOM Events Level 3.
