TV is a mature but rapidly-changing market. With the advent of IP-based devices, connected TVs are progressing at a fast pace and traditional TV broadcasting is quickly evolving into a more
immersive experience where users can interact with rich applications that are at least partly based on Web technologies. There is strong growth in the deployment of devices that integrate regular
Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and SVG, coupled with various device APIs.


What is Web and Television?


There is huge potential for the future to create an interoperable platform where Web and TV benefit from each other. For instance, TV comes with quality of services requirements for video delivery
that would benefit video delivery on the Web, e.g. through the introduction of HTTP adaptive streaming mechanisms. Similarly, exposing additional functionalities to the Web browser that are commonly
found on TV such as trick mode replay (fast rewind, fast forward) or channel control would facilitate the integration of Web browsers within TV sets.

Due to its central position as a home device, TV is the primary screen for many second-screen scenarios, whereby a second device (laptop, mobile phone) interacts with the TV set to enlarge the
possibilities in terms of user interactions with the show that the user watches. This includes gaming, shopping, or synchronized browsing scenarios.
