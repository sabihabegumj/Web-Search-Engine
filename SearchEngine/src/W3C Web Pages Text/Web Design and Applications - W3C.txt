Web Design and Applications involve the standards for building and Rendering Web pages, including HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for Web Applications (&#x201C;WebApps&#x201D;).
This section also includes information on how to make pages accessible to people with disabilities (WCAG), to internationalize them, and make them work on mobile devices.










HTML and CSS are the fundamental technologies for building Web pages: HTML (html and xhtml) for structure, CSS for style and layout, including WebFonts. Find resources for good Web page design as
well as helpful tools.







Standard APIs for client-side Web Application development include those for Geolocation, XMLHttpRequest, and mobile widgets. W3C standards for document models (the &#x201C;DOM&#x201D;) and
technologies such as XBL allow content providers to create interactive documents through scripting.







W3C is the home of the widely deployed PNG raster format, SVG vector format, and the Canvas API. WebCGM is a more specialized format used, for example, in the fields of automotive engineering,
aeronautics.









Some of the W3C formats that enable authoring audio and video presentations include HTML, SVG, and SMIL (for synchronization). W3C is also working on a timed text format for captioning and other
applications.







W3C&#x2019;s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has published Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to help authors create content that is accessible to people with disabilities. WAI-ARIA
gives authors more tools to create accessible Web Applications by providing additional semantics about widgets and behaviors.







W3C has a mission to design technology that works across cultures and languages. W3C standards such as HTML and XML are built on Unicode, for instance. In addition, W3C has published guidance for
authors related to language tags bi-directional (bidi) text, and more.









W3C promotes &#x201C;One Web&#x201D; that is available on any device. W3C&#x2019;s Mobile Web Best Practices help authors understand how to create content that provides a reasonable experience on a
wide variety of devices, contexts, and locations.







The Web is a powerful tool for communications and transactions of all sorts. It is important to consider privacy and security implications of the Web as part of technology design. Learn more about
tracking and Web App security.







Mathematics and formula are used on the Web for business reports, education materials and scientific research. W3C&#x2019;s MathML enables mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the
World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for other types of content.

HTML5: On Our Way to Recommendation


17 June 2014

from W3C HTML Working Group



In 2012, the HTML Working Group Chairs came up with a plan to progress HTML, aka &#x201C; Plan 2014&#x201C;. The plan has several objectives:

* Produce a W3C Recommendation for HTML 5.0 before the end of 2014, as well as a W3C Recommendation for HTML 5.1 before the end of 2016;
* Use the Candidate Recommendation of HTML5, which started in December 2012, to focus the testing effort where it is appropriate;
* Use modularity to manage the size and complexity of the specifications.

Over the past 2 years, we have continued to refine and improve the HTML 5.0 specification. The HTML Working Group receives and tracks proposals from a variety of people in the community, most
prominently from the WHATWG. During the past 2 years, the HTML5 editors have worked with the community to exchange ideas and thus avoid divergence among specifications. The HTML Landscapelists the
differences between various HTML specifications.

The HTML Working Group today has 97,000 tests for HTML5. As part of satisfying the W3C process requirements for Candidate Recommendation, we have tracked implementations of HTML5 features, and test
results today show that there are at least 2 implementations for 96.7% of the available tests. What about the other 3.3%? Those failures arise from how different browsers handle errors, and the
Working Group has concluded that these failures do not reflect differences in implementations that will significantly affect interoperability of real-world running code. Following the test results,
we removed several features from HTML 5.0due to their lack of implementations and stability, including the dialog element and scoped style sheet. Those features remain in the draft HTML 5.1
specification for the time being.

W3C would like to thank the community for helping to build this valuable test suite. The tests come from the Test the Web Forward community effort and the contributors to the web-platform-tests
github repository, and we strongly encourage Web developers to continue to contribute to the testing effort and help make the Open Web Platform reliable. At the moment, the HTML Working Group is
specifically looking for additional HTML 5.0 tests related to media elements and page navigation.

As planned, given the substantive changes made to the document, we&#x2019;re returning HTML 5.0 to Last Call. The scope of the expected feedback at this point is limited to changes that have taken
place during the Candidate Recommendation phase and the deadline is 15 July 2014. Once we have addressed the Last Call comments and finalize the test suite, we expect to move the document to
Proposed Recommendation in the fall. A few features may be removed from HTML 5.0 but kept in HTML 5.1 if we can&#x2019;t get enough implementations: the DataCue interface, <input type=time>, drag
and drop, and the new ruby model.

Advancing HTML 5.0 towards Recommendation status is just one step in advancing the Open Web Platform, a full-fledged programming environment for rich, interactive, cross-platform applications, with
HTML5 at its core. Several Groups are extending the HTML markup language, including for responsive design, performance, accessibility or additional security purposes. The HTML Working Group, the W3C
Technical Architecture Group and the Web Applications Working Group, are looking to have an Extensible Web Summit in the middle of September where we will discuss the future of HTML. We expect a
formal announcement in early July.






Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0


17 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebDesign







Version 7.0 of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 new characters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols for the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250
emoji (pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-used and historic scripts, as well as character additions to many existing scripts. These additions extend support for written
languages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries, and Africa. See the link above for full details.

Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings fonts.

Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. New property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joining
behavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements, the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can be
significantly improved.

Unicode character properties were extended to the new characters. The old characters have enhancements to Script and Alphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. There were also
nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations.

Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version 7.0. These will be released at the same time:

UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm&#x2014; the standard for sorting Unicode text
UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing&#x2014; for processing of non-ASCII URLs (IDNs)






Workshop report: Summary of the LD4LT group kickoff / LIDER roadmapping workshop


11 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebDesign



The LIDER project has published a report on the first Linked Data for Language Technology event, which was held 21st March in alignment with the European Data Forum in Athens. Read the report.

Industry stakeholders from many areas (localization, publishing, language technology applications etc.) and key researchers from linked data and language technology discussed promises and challenges
around linguistic linked data. The report summarizes all presentations and includes an initial list of use cases and requirements for linguistic linked data. This and the overall outcome of the
event will feed into work of the LD4LT group (see especially the LD4LT latest draft version of use cases), and the field of multilingual linked data in general.

The LD4LT group is part of the MultilingualWeb community &#x2013; learn more about related projects.






Last Call draft published for Encoding spec


06 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebDesign



A Last Call Working Draft of Encodinghas been published.

While encodings have been defined to some extent, implementations have not always implemented them in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined
and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders
and existing implementations can converge.

The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version as of the date of its publication, intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications. We are hoping for people to review
the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention (see the Status section for details).

Please send comments by 1 July 2014.






Updates to two Working Group Notes published


06 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebDesign



Authoring HTML: Handling Right-to-left Scripts and Authoring HTML: Language declarationshave both been updated to a new format that lists do&#x2019;s and don&#x2019;ts, but points to existing or new
articles for detailed information. This will significantly help in keeping the material up to date in the future as technology changes. The documents have also been thoroughly overhauled to reflect
the latest changes and information on

The first document provides advice to content authors using HTML markup and CSS style sheets about how to create pages for languages that use right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian,
Thaana, Urdu, etc. It explains how to create content in right-to-left scripts that builds on but goes beyond the Unicode bidirectional algorithm, as well as how to prepare content for localization
into right-to-left scripts.

The second helps content authors specify the language of content, which is useful for a wide number of applications, from linguistically-sensitive searching to applying language-specific display
properties. In some cases the potential applications for language information are still waiting for implementations to catch up, whereas in others it is a necessity today. Adding markup for language
information to content is something that can and should be done now and as content is first developed. If not, it will be much more difficult to take advantage of any future developments.
