Although the Extensible Markup Language (XML) itself has a very short specification for such an important format, there are a lot of specifications in and around XML that are considered very
important.


Overview of XML Components


XML Base
        Override the default URI of a document or any part of a document starting at a given element;
Stylesheets in XML
        Associate an XSLT transformation with an XML document, for example so that a Web browser will format it;
XLink
        A vocabulary for hypertext in XML;
xml:id
        Identify an XML attribute or element as containing a name that can be used as a unique identifier within a document;
XInclude
        Include all or part of other text or XML documents, or duplicate part of the current XML document;
XPointer
        This is a framework for different ways to point into XML documents, and is used by XLink;
XForms
        A more powerful cousin to HTML forms;
XML Events, XHTML Modularization
        Specifications primarily relating to the use of XML in Web browsers or other DOM-based systems;
XML Fragments
        Listed here only for completeness; this specification is not in widespread use.
