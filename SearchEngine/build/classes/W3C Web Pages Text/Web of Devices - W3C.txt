W3C is focusing on technologies to enable Web access anywhere, anytime, using any device. This includes Web access from mobile phones and other mobile devices as well as use of Web technology in
consumer electronics, printers, interactive television, and even automobiles.










W3C promotes &#x201C;One Web&#x201D; that is available on any device. W3C&#x2019;s Mobile Web Initiative helps ensure the best user experience on mobile devices, taking into account device
capabilities, location, and other context information.







The W3C Speech Interface Framework is a suite of specifications (e.g. VoiceXML) integrating Web technology and speech interaction. VoiceXML, PLS, SISR, SRGS, SCXML, and CCXML all contribute to the
Speech Interface Framework.







Devices come in many shapes, capabilities and sizes which define constraints on the content these devices can handle. Device descriptions, content transformation guidelines, device APIs and CC/PP
help developers to optimize the user experience.









Increasingly, interactions with devices doesn&#x2019;t only happen with a keyboard, but also through voice, touch and gestures. The W3C Multimodal architecture and its components (EMMA, InkML) allow
developers to adapt applications to new interaction modes.







With the advent of IP-based devices, connected TVs are progressing at a fast pace and traditional TV broadcasting is quickly evolving into a more immersive experience where users can interact with
rich applications that are at least partly based on Web technologies. There is strong growth in the deployment of devices that integrate regular Web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and SVG, coupled
with various device APIs.

Announcing The Unicode Standard, Version 7.0


17 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebOfDevices







Version 7.0 of the Unicode Standardis now available, adding 2,834 new characters. This latest version adds the new currency symbols for the Russian ruble and Azerbaijani manat, approximately 250
emoji (pictographic symbols), many other symbols, and 23 new lesser-used and historic scripts, as well as character additions to many existing scripts. These additions extend support for written
languages of North America, China, India, other Asian countries, and Africa. See the link above for full details.

Most of the new emoji characters derive from characters in long-standing and widespread use in Wingdings and Webdings fonts.

Major enhancements were made to the Indic script properties. New property values were added to enable a more algorithmic approach to rendering Indic scripts. These include properties for joining
behavior, new classes for numbers, and a further division of the syllabic categories of viramas and rephas. With these enhancements, the default rendering for newly added Indic scripts can be
significantly improved.

Unicode character properties were extended to the new characters. The old characters have enhancements to Script and Alphabetic properties, and casing and line-breaking behavior. There were also
nearly 3,000 new Cantonese pronunciation entries, as well as new or clarified stability policies for promoting interoperable implementations.

Two other important Unicode specifications are maintained in synchrony with the Unicode Standard, and have updates for Version 7.0. These will be released at the same time:

UTS #10, Unicode Collation Algorithm&#x2014; the standard for sorting Unicode text
UTS #46, Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing&#x2014; for processing of non-ASCII URLs (IDNs)






Last Call draft published for Encoding spec


06 June 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebOfDevices



A Last Call Working Draft of Encodinghas been published.

While encodings have been defined to some extent, implementations have not always implemented them in the same way, have not always used the same labels, and often differ in dealing with undefined
and former proprietary areas of encodings. This specification attempts to fill those gaps so that new implementations do not have to reverse engineer encoding implementations of the market leaders
and existing implementations can converge.

The body of this spec is an exact copy of the WHATWG version as of the date of its publication, intended to provide a stable reference for other specifications. We are hoping for people to review
the specification and send comments about any technical areas that need attention (see the Status section for details).

Please send comments by 1 July 2014.

Program published for W3C MultilingualWeb Workshop in Madrid, 7-8 May


11 April 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebOfDevices







See the program.The keynote speaker will be Alolita Sharma, Director of Language Engineering from the Wikimedia Foundation. She is followed by a strong line up in sessions entitled Developers,
Creators, Localizers, Machines, and Users, including speakers from Microsoft, Wikimedia Foundation, the UN FAO, W3C, Yandex, SDL, Lionbridge, Asia Pacific TLD, Verisign, DFKI, and many more. On the
afternoon of the second day we will hold Open Space breakout discussions. Abstracts and details about an additional poster session will be provided shortly.

The program will also feature an LD4LT event on May 8-9, focusing on text analytics and the usefulness of Wikipedia and Dbpedia for multiilngual text and content analytics, and on language resources
and aspects of converting selected types of language resources into RDF.

Participation in both events is free. See the Call for Participation for details about how to register for the MultilingualWeb workshop. The LD4LT event requires a separate registrationand you have
the opportunity to submit position statements about language resources and RDF.

If you haven&#x2019;t registered yet, note that space is limited, so please be sure to register soon to ensure that you get a place.

The MultilingualWeb workshops, funded by the European Commission and coordinated by the W3C, look at best practices and standards related to all aspects of creating, localizing and deploying the
multilingual Web. The workshops are successful because they attract a wide range of participants, from fields such as localization, language technology, browser development, content authoring and
tool development, etc., to create a holistic view of the interoperability needs of the multilingual Web.

We look forward to seeing you in Madrid!

Speaker deadline for Madrid MultilingualWeb Workshop is Friday, March 14


05 March 2014

from Internationalization Activity Blog &#xBB; w3cWebOfDevices



We would like to remind you that the deadline for speaker proposals for the 7th MultilingualWeb Workshop (May 7&#x2013;8, 2014, Madrid, Spain) is on Friday, March 14, at 23:59 UTC.

Featuring a keynote by Alolita Sharma (Director of Engineering, Wikipedia) and breakout sessions on linked open data and other critical topics, this Workshop will focus on the advances and
challenges faced in making the Web truly multilingual. It provides an outstanding and influential forum for thought leaders to share their ideas and gain critical feedback.

While the organizers have already received many excellent submissions, there is still time to make a proposal, and we encourage interested parties to do so by the deadline. With roughly 200
attendees anticipated for the Workshop from a wide variety of profiles, we are certain to have a large and diverse audience that can provide constructive and useful feedback, with stimulating
discussion about all of the presentations.

  Workshop on the Web of Things

  Berlin, Germany

  Hosted by Siemens


  Participants in this workshop will examine the potential for open standards as a basis for services, either between devices, at the network edge, e.g. in home hubs, or in the cloud. They will
  discuss the use of web protocols and scripting languages for implementing services, the need for APIs for implementing drivers for specific IoT technologies, a shared approach to describing
  services as a basis for interoperability, and the underlying use of HTTP/COAP, Web Sockets, and EXI/JSON for RESTful services.
